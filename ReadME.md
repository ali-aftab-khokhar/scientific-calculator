Project Description:
| Use learned concepts of JavaScript to create a calculator application with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Follow the latest ES6/ES7 syntax learned above. Kindly don’t waste your time on making the calculator visually appealing. Focus only on implementing the requirements.

Modules:
1. Expressions:
    | The calculator should be able to parse full expressions using mathematical rules.
    | The calculator should support following operations with the mentioned symbols:
        - Addition:  +
        - Subtraction: -
        - Multiplication: *
        - Division: /
        - Exponentiation: ^
        - Precedence/Parentheses: ( expression... )
        - Square root: sqrt( expression… )
        - Sine: sin( expression… )
        - Cosine: cos( expression… )
        - Tangent: tan( expression… )
    | Cross check your results using a scientific calculator with its corresponding symbols.
    | Whitespaces should be trimmed.

2. Text/Expression Input
    | The calculator should have an editable text input.
    | The user should be able to freely type in the desired expression through the keyboard.
    | The expression should also update accordingly when the corresponding calculator button is clicked by the user.

3. Output Display
    | The calculator should have a display where the entered expression's result is shown.
    | Text input should not be overridden to display the result.
    | The output should be fixed to 4 decimal points.

4. Buttons
    | The calculator should have buttons for entering each element of the expression in the text input.
    | Similarly, respective buttons should be added to fulfill the project requirements.

5. Exception Handling
    | The application should handle all exceptions like dividing by zero or incomplete/wrong expression etc.
    | A helpful error message should be shown on the output display.

6. Variables and Constants
    | Calculator should support adding the following constants in expressions:
        - Pi: pi (3.1415)
        - Euler’s Number: e (2.7182)
    | Calculator should support adding variables in the expressions.
    | It should do so by creating a view with input(s) that allow the user to assign a name and a primitive value to a variable.
    | The user should not be able to create a variable with the names of previously mentioned constants.
    | When the user types these variables and constants in expressions, they should be evaluated to their stored values.

7. History
    | The app should maintain the history of all evaluated expressions with their results (a history item).
    | The view should allow the user to fill text input when a history item is clicked.
    | The user should be able to delete an item from history.
